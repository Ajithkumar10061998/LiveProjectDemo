# Automated Software Testing Project

## Overview

This repository contains an automated software testing project implemented using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Log4j, and a `config.properties` file for configuration. The project is designed to facilitate the testing of a web application by automating various test scenarios.

## Tools and Technologies

### TestNG
- TestNG is a testing framework for Java that allows us to create and manage test cases.
- It supports the organization of tests into suites, setting up dependencies between test methods, and generating detailed test reports.

### Log4j
- Log4j is a logging framework for Java that helps manage log messages.
- We use Log4j to log test execution details and any issues or errors encountered during testing.
- The Test execution details are logged in logging.log File
### `config.properties`
- The `config.properties` file is used for storing configuration settings for the testing project.
- It contains properties such as URLs, credentials, browser configurations, and other settings that can be easily configured without modifying code.

### Java
- Java is the primary programming language used for writing and executing test scripts.
- It provides the foundation for creating automated test cases.

### Selenium WebDriver
- Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers, commonly used for web application testing.
- Selenium WebDriver is employed in this project to automate interactions with web elements within the web application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the automated tests on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone-https://github.com/Ajithkumar10061998/LiveProjectDemo

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the necessary dependencies. You may use a build tool like Maven to manage dependencies:

 
4. Configure the `config.properties` file:
- Open the `config.properties` file in the project's root directory.
- Update the properties according to your testing environment (e.g., URLs, browser settings, credentials).

5. Run the tests using TestNG:

 
6. View the test execution results and logs.

## Test Structure

The tests in this project are organized using TestNG and follow a structured approach. You can find the test classes in the `src/test/java` directory.

## Logging

Logging of test execution details and any errors encountered during testing is managed using Log4j. You can configure the logging behavior in the `log4j.properties` file.

## Reporting

TestNG provides built-in reporting features, and you can generate detailed test execution reports by configuring the `testng.xml` file.
The Test execution details are logged in logging.log File

## Maintenance

To maintain and extend the test suite:
- Add new test cases or test classes as needed.
- Update the `config.properties` file to reflect changes in the testing environment.
- Keep your project dependencies up-to-date.
